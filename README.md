# GenericMatrices
Create generic classes to represent square, symmetric, and diagonal matrices. The case of rectangular matrices is not considered.
a symmetric matrix is a square matrix that matches the one transposed to it;
a diagonal matrix is a square matrix whose elements outside the main diagonal have default values ​​of the element type.
Organize the storage of elements in the matrix in an optimal way.
In the created classes, describe the event that occurs when an element of the matrix with indices (i, j) changes. Expand the functionality of the existing (conditionally stable) class hierarchy (do not change the hierarchy itself) by adding the ability to add two matrices of any type. Consider two solutions
expression trees;
type dynamic.
Develop unit tests.
